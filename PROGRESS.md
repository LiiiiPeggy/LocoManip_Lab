# PROGRESS.md — Current Project State

A snapshot, not a log. Delete what is no longer true; do not append history here (that is
PROCESS.md). Do not record unverified conclusions.

**Last verified: 2026-09-22** — every claim below was produced by re-running the command on this
machine, unless marked otherwise.

## Current objective

Getting the repository's training pipeline running reliably at scale against **GO2-PIPER**, then
producing a real WBC policy. A first policy now exists (below); the open work is verifying it end to
end in MuJoCo and deciding how much further to train it.

*Inferred from repository evidence, not stated by the user — confirm or correct:*
only `go2_piper_base.usd` is tracked in git, and every training run so far is `GO2-PIPER-WBC`.

## Verified working

### Runtime environment

Confirmed by direct inspection on 2026-09-21, conda env `env_isaaclab5`:

| component | version | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `rsl-rl-lib` | 5.0.1 | README requires ≥ 5.0.1 |
| `isaaclab` | 0.54.4 | editable → `/home/ubuntu/locomani/IsaacLab5/source/isaaclab` |
| `isaaclab_rl` | 0.5.2 | editable → `/home/ubuntu/locomani/IsaacLab5/source/isaaclab_rl` |
| `isaacsim` | 5.1.0.0 | pip-installed |

- Isaac Sim starts headless and `import LeggedManip_Lab.tasks` executes cleanly → the extension is
  installed and registered.
- The conda env `isaaclab` has `rsl-rl-lib 2.3.1` → **incompatible**, do not use.

### Training runs end to end

`python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task GO2-PIPER-WBC --num_envs <N> --headless --max_iterations <M>`
completed on all six configurations. Each run wrote its final checkpoint (`model_{M-1}.pt`) beside
`model_0.pt`, plus 46 TensorBoard scalars — i.e. no run was silently swallowed (see AGENTS.md).

| num_envs | max_iterations | fps (last iter) | s / iteration |
|---------:|---------------:|----------------:|--------------:|
|       64 |              3 |           2 136 |          0.72 |
|    1 024 |             30 |          23 188 |          1.06 |
|    4 096 |             20 |          71 372 |          1.38 |
|    8 192 |             15 |         119 888 |          1.64 |
|   16 384 |             15 |         162 057 |          2.43 |
|   32 768 |             10 |         194 147 |          4.05 |

`s / iteration` = `num_envs × 24 / fps` (one iteration is 24 steps per env, collection + learning).
Hardware: 1× RTX A6000 (48 GB); peak training footprint ≈ 17.6 GB at 32 768 envs.

Evidence: `logs/rsl_rl/go2_piper_wbc/2026-09-21_*/` (tfevents, `model_*.pt`, `params/`, `git/`);
launcher dirs in `outputs/2026-09-21/*/.hydra/`. All six runs record the same seed (`42`) and
experiment name (`go2_piper_wbc`).

### `scripts/list_envs.py` filter fix — verified

The working-tree change replaces the `spec.entry_point` check with
`spec.kwargs["env_cfg_entry_point"]`. Measured over one live registry: old filter → **0** rows,
new filter → **28** rows (7 platforms × Flat/WBC × normal/`-Play`).

**Status: committed on branch `rangercr10`.**

### First WBC policy trained, exported and staged for MuJoCo (2026-09-22)

`python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task GO2-PIPER-WBC --num_envs 8192 --headless --max_iterations 2500`
completed in **3 825.74 s (63.8 min)** = 8192 × 24 × 2500 = **4.92e8 env steps**, run directory
`logs/rsl_rl/go2_piper_wbc/2026-09-21_22-40-10/` (`model_{0,1000,2000,2499}.pt`, tfevents, `params/`).

| iteration | mean reward | episode length | ee position error | ee orientation error | base_contact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | −1.39 | 22 | 0.477 | 0.830 | 0.031 |
| 250 | 80.81 | 996 | 0.485 | 0.128 | 0.017 |
| 1000 | 150.19 | 1000 | 0.101 | 0.136 | 0.005 |
| 2499 | 157.52 | 1000 | **0.065** | **0.095** | **0.0017** |

End-effector position error 0.477 → 0.065 m and orientation error 0.830 → 0.095: WBC tracking works
under the mixed-frame command. Episode length saturates at the 1000-step cap by iteration ~250 and
`base_contact` falls to 0.0017, so the robot is not falling. Learning flattens but does not stop —
`Mean action std` is still 0.45 at iteration 2 499, and the config default is 10 000 iterations, so
this run covers roughly a quarter of the schedule.

Artifacts (each verified by loading/playing it back, not by exit code):

- `logs/…/exported/policy.pt` and `policy.onnx`.
- `logs/…/videos/play/rl-video-step-0.mp4` — 50 envs, 500 steps, 1280×720 @50fps, 10 s
  (`play.py --task GO2-PIPER-WBC-Play --headless --video --video_length 500`).
- **`mujoco/deploy/policy/go2_piper/wbc/policy.pt` now holds this trained policy.** The shipped
  pretrained weights are kept next to it as `policy_pretrained.pt` (md5
  `63a9ca42e1aaf4d30d392f38c14a42e3`); roll back with
  `cp policy_pretrained.pt policy.pt`. Both files load with the same `(1, 210) → (1, 18)` signature,
  which is the observation the MuJoCo deploy script assembles.

## Open problems

1. The MuJoCo deployment path is still **untested end to end**. The policy file is in place and its
   I/O signature matches, but `go2_piper.py` has not yet been run against it.
2. Local git history is a single `first commit` (`7ca5f66`). The upstream commit recorded in the
   training logs (`8b817d7d23f0…`) exists as an object but is reachable from no ref, so comparing
   against or rebasing onto upstream is no longer possible in this clone.
3. `pre-commit` and `ruff` are not installed in `env_isaaclab5`, so the hooks in
   `.pre-commit-config.yaml` could not be run here; commits were checked by hand (trailing
   whitespace, final newline, the 5000 KB `check-added-large-files` limit) instead.

## Next steps

1. Run `python mujoco/deploy/deploy_mujoco/go2_piper/go2_piper.py config_wbc.yaml` to close the loop
   on the trained policy.
2. Decide whether to continue to the config's 10 000 iterations
   (`--resume --load_run 2026-09-21_22-40-10`, ≈1.5 h more at 8192 envs): reward and tracking error
   were still improving slowly at iteration 2 500.
3. Compare the trained policy against `policy_pretrained.pt` under the same `config_wbc.yaml`.
4. Decide the fate of the six gitignored `*_base.usd` assets (see PROCESS.md §3).
5. **New platform**: the port plan for the wheeled `rangerboxcr10lidar` (AgileX Ranger 4WS/4WD +
   Dobot CR10 + AG95) is at `docs/plans/plan.md`. **Stage 0 is done; stage 1 has not started.**
   The scheme was **revised on 2026-09-23**: the base is no longer an external velocity command.
   The policy now outputs **8 dims — `[vx, wz, cr10_joint1..6]`** (`vx`, `wz` limited to ±0.5, no
   `vy`), so RL decides the chassis motion and the arm together given an end-effector pose target;
   the 8 chassis joints stay out of the action space and are resolved by a base controller in sim /
   by the AgileX driver on the real robot (`/cmd_vel`), which keeps the two semantics identical.
   Still locked: joint limits follow `rangercr10lidar.urdf`, end-effector frame is the gripper
   fingertip centre, one unified 10 Hz policy (200 Hz physics, `decimation = 20`, base held
   zero-order between policy steps). The speed-tracking rewards are dropped in favour of base
   velocity and base action-rate penalties.
   **R5 is resolved (2026-09-23)**: the end-effector target is kept in the **world frame** internally
   (`target_pose_w`, resampled as the current base pose plus a local offset and then frozen for that
   command's lifetime), the policy observes it **relative to `base_link`** (`target_pose_b`), and the
   tracking reward is computed **in the world frame** — a new `UniformPoseWorldCommand` used only by
   `ranger_cr10`, leaving GO2-PIPER's `UniformPoseWBCCommand` untouched. This is what makes "targets
   that require driving the base" exist at all.
   Remaining open items are the plan's §9 R1, R3 and R4 (TCP offset, success criteria, robot access).

   **Stage 0 (URDF→USD) complete**: `assets/ranger_cr10/` holds the conversion-only URDF, config,
   driver script and the USD (22 MB, kept as a regular Git object like the source meshes). Verified
   by a printed joint table: 22 joints, correct parenting, arm limits equal to the URDF's.
   Two things differ from go2_piper and are easy to get wrong — see the plan's stage-0 notes:
   `convert_mimic_joints_to_normal_joints` must be **true** here (the AG95 has 7 mimic joints, and
   `false` leaves them as free hinges), and the USD's limits are in **degrees** on both platforms.
   The source meshes were decimated first: 83 MB / 1.73 M faces → 19 MB / 0.38 M faces.

## Known minor documentation drift (verify before editing docs)

Recorded because it misleads edits; neither item changes runtime behavior.

- `PROJECT_INTRO.md` §6 says "所有 8 个机器人"; `README.md` and `PROJECT_INTRO.md` §3 both say
  7 platforms.
- `PROJECT_INTRO.md` §5.5 lists a reward term `arm_torques_max` (−5e-5), but the completed runs log
  `Episode_Reward/arm_deviation` and no `arm_torques_max` tag exists in any run.
